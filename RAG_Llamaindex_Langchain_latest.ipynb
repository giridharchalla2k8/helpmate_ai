        "To address the challenge of answering questions based on unstructured document data (such as insurance policies), a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution has been implemented. This solution leverages LlamaIndex for document parsing, indexing, and retrieval, and LangChain for managing LLM interactions, prompting, and response generation. These retrieves the most relevant context from documents and uses it to generate accurate, grounded responses via an OpenAI LLM.\n",
